				a grade 9 student attending the IB program at Victoria Park Collegiate 
				Institute. I am a male and my birthday is October 31, 2006, which is 
				pretty cool because my birthday is on Halloween! I was born in Toronto, 
				Canada and have live here my whole life. At the time of creating this 
				webpage, I am currently taking ICS, a computer science course, which has
				brought me to the creation of this. On this webpage, you will find some
				information about myself, my family, my hobbies/interests and learn some 
				fun facts about me.</td>

			<tr>
				<td class="p" style="width:70%;">So far, I've been to 4 schools, the first
				of which being Terry Fox P.S. I went there from Kindergarten to grade 3, 
				which I was then placed into the gifted program at Fairglen J.P.S, which I
				stayed there up until grade 6. I then moved to a middle school called J.B. 
				Tyrrell and stayed in the gifted program until grade 8. I am currently 
				enrolled in the Pre-IB program here at Victoria Park C.I, which I hope to 
				stay in for the following years. Due to the pandemic, this year is a little 
				different, education and personal wise, so things are quite different, but
				that just means more self learning and time management, 2 things which my 
				previous schools and programs also needed both of those things.
				<br>
				<br>
				As for extracurriculars, I take piano lessons and play many sports, 
				including hockey, baseball and golf. In school last year, I was part of 
				the student council and helped out in the library and office sometimes. I 
				used to volunteer at places, but because of Covid&#45;19, I stopped for a while, 
				and haven't gone back since.
